GENERAL TODO'S
--------------

 * Get dixon's UUID fork commited to the upstream UUID project.
   http://drupal.org/node/1212954

 * Simplify DeployIterator. Right now $collection can be recursive, but no
   implementaor will ever use it. DeployIterator will still look for
   dependencies recursively. So remove that feature.

 * See if we can integrate with Entity API and hook_entity_property_info() in a
   way. Would be nice if we just could mark properties and fields as holding
   a dependency, eventually with a 'dependency callback' similar to the
   'getter callback'. This would save a lot of dependency code and make
   'hook_deploy_entity_dependency' redundant.

 * Oversee how default config keys should be set in plugin objects.

 * See if we really need to define plugins through hooks. Is $plugin enough
   maybe, like 'content_types' etc. are defined. Performance implications?
