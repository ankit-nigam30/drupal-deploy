GENERAL TODO'S
--------------

 * Oversee how the iterator works. Prefereably it should be able to return fully
   wrapped entities. See DeployEndpoint::deploy().

 * Oversee how default config keys should be set in plugin objects.

 * See if we really need to define plugins through hooks. Is $plugin enough
   maybe, like 'content_types' etc. are defined. Performance implications?
