GENERAL TODO'S
--------------

 * Get dixon's UUID fork commited to the upstream UUID project.
   http://drupal.org/node/1212954

 * See if we can add the observer pattern more natively in the API to detect
   deployed items. Or is it enough with just a plain hook instead of the class?

 * Oversee how the iterator works. We can probably optimize it and make it more
   "readable" and easy to follow.

 * Oversee how default config keys should be set in plugin objects.

 * See if we really need to define plugins through hooks. Is $plugin enough
   maybe, like 'content_types' etc. are defined. Performance implications?
