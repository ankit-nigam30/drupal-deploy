GENERAL TODO'S
--------------

 * I want to leave out the remote saving out of the Deploy module. We should
   only care about the UUID and skip the whole cross communication to figure out
   the remote IDs that happened in Deploy 6.x. So it's up to the remote to save
   its entities based on the UUID. So we need to create a new module called
   'services_uuid_entity'. That module will expose a REST service that saves
   entities based on their UUID. The mapping is done locally on the site. And
   for this to work the UUID module needs a function called 'uuid_entity_save()'
   that can save entities based on their UUID. That function might need to be
   abstracted to it's own module to depend on the Entity API module that
   provides the proper 'entity_save()'. So short conclusion:

     - Create services_uuid_entity.module

     - Patch uuid.module to support saving entities based on UUID.

 * Oversee how the iterator works. We can probably optimize it and make it more
   "readable" and easy to follow.

 * Oversee how default config keys should be set in plugin objects.

 * See if we really need to define plugins through hooks. Is $plugin enough
   maybe, like 'content_types' etc. are defined. Performance implications?
