BEFORE LAUNCH
-------------
- edit servers callback
- deployment plan item weighting

IMMEDIATELY AFTER
-----------------
- installation / implementation guide. FAQ
- Logging / auditing (new table)
- Confirmation of install (?)
- Views
- Blocks and other non ssf settings
- Delete confirmations (can you do this without two callbacks, see content type delete)
- doxygen
- simpletests
- move some code to includes?
- better error handling on services
- better menu organization (so breadcrumb is better)
