GENERAL TODO'S
--------------

 * Get dixon's UUID fork commited to the upstream UUID project.
   http://drupal.org/node/1212954

 * Find a solution to the problem where deployments can't be done with UID 1.
   The reason is because UID 1 don't have the same UUID on the endpoint, since
   that user is always created during installation. A possible solution could be
   to provide a UI where manual update of UID 1 UUID is possible.

 * All processors should set a message about the deployment.

 * Implement hook_help() where needed.

 * Make all plugins more private and isolate necessary methods and parameters.

 * Change the 'eid' key to 'entity_id' to be consistent with core.

 * Change 'items' and 'collection' to 'entities', since that is what we really
   are dealing with.

 * See if we can integrate with Entity API and hook_entity_property_info() in a
   way. Would be nice if we just could mark properties and fields as holding
   a dependency, eventually with a 'dependency callback' similar to the
   'getter callback'. This would save a lot of dependency code and make
   'hook_deploy_entity_dependency' redundant.

 * Oversee how default config keys should be set in plugin objects.

 * See if we really need to define plugins through hooks. Is $plugin enough
   maybe, like 'content_types' etc. are defined. Performance implications?
